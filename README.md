> [!WARNING]
> MetroFuse connects to third-party services selected by the user. Availability, quality, catalog coverage, login behavior, and regional access can change at any time and may require your own account, VPN, proxy, or provider access.    

Additionally this unoffical fork of Metrolist is completely different backend and frontend wise dont ask the metrolist devs for help with this fork.

## What Is MetroFuse?

MetroFuse is a fork of Metrolist focused on combining multiple music frontpages and playback providers in one Android app. It keeps the familiar Material 3 player, library, lyrics, queue, widgets, and playlist tools while adding source switching for different discovery and playback workflows.

The default playback path is Qobuz-first, with other enabled providers used only when the primary source cannot produce a playable stream.

| Provider fallback when a stream misses | Spotify-style personalized frontpage |
| Background playback | TIDAL-style personalized frontpage |
| Downloads and cache for offline use | Search songs, albums, artists, videos, and playlists |
| Skip silence and sleep timer | Open external playlists inside MetroFuse |
